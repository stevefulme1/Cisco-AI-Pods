## 1. Workload Characterization and Sizing

### 1.1 Using the UCS AI Sizer Tool

The **UCS AI Sizer Tool** is a critical resource for accurate capacity planning and should be your starting point for any Cisco AI Pods project.

**Tool Access:**
- Web Tool: [https://ucsszr.cloudapps.cisco.com/ucsappsizer/](https://ucsszr.cloudapps.cisco.com/ucsappsizer/project/all)
- Used by Cisco sales engineers to validate designs and generate bill-of-materials (BOMs)
- Provides project customization and exports for procurement and planning

**Using the UCS AI Sizer:**

1. **Create a New Project:**
   - Navigate to the sizer tool and create a new project
  - Input project name, workload type (Training / Inference / Mixed), and target performance metrics
   - Specify geographic region and timeline for procurement

2. **Define Your Workload:**
   - Model type and framework (PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, etc.)
   - Model size (parameters) and precision (FP32, BF16, FP8)
   - Batch size per GPU and number of concurrent users/jobs
   - Training duration or inference throughput SLA
   - Data volume and preprocessing requirements

3. **Select Scale Unit:**
   - **SU1:** 32 GPUs (4 × UCS C885A-M8 servers with 8 GPUs each)
   - **SU2:** 64 GPUs (8 × UCS C885A-M8 servers)
   - **SU3:** 128 GPUs (16 × UCS C885A-M8 servers)
    - Can mix GPU types (B300, H200, RTX6000, RTX4500, etc.)

4. **Review Recommendations:**
   - Compute capacity (GPU count, server configuration)
   - Network fabric specifications (leaf/spine switches, port speeds)
   - Storage capacity and throughput requirements
   - Power and cooling estimates
   - Software components (drivers, CUDA, frameworks)

5. **Export Results:**
   - Generate detailed bill-of-materials (BOM)
   - Technical specifications document
   - Network topology diagram
   - Share with procurement and infrastructure teams

### 1.2 Model Size and Memory Calculations

**Memory Requirement Formula:**
```
Total VRAM per GPU = (Model Size) + (Activation Memory) + (Optimizer State) + (Batch Data)

Model Size = Parameters × Precision Bytes
  - FP32 (full precision): 4 bytes per parameter
  - BF16 (mixed precision): 2 bytes per parameter
  - FP8 (quantized): 1 byte per parameter

Activation Memory ≈ Model Size × Activation Factor (typically 2-4× model size for transformer models)

Optimizer State (Adam) ≈ 2-3× Model Size (maintains momentum and variance)
```

**Example: 70B Parameter Model Deployment**

| Precision | Model Size | Activation Mem | Optimizer | Per-GPU Total | Suitable GPU |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| FP32 | 280 GB | 560 GB | 840 GB | 1.68 TB | Not feasible on single B300 (288GB) or H200 (141GB) |
| BF16 | 140 GB | 280 GB | 420 GB | 840 GB | Not feasible on single B300 (288GB) or H200 (141GB) |
| BF16 + LoRA | 140 GB | 140 GB | 50 GB | 330 GB | Distributed across 2×B300 or 3×H200 |
| FP8 Quant | 70 GB | 140 GB | 0 GB (inference) | 210 GB | Feasible on 1×B300 or 2×H200 |

**Recommendations:**
- For training: plan 1.5-2× model size in GPU memory headroom
- For inference: use quantization (FP8/INT8) to reduce memory footprint by 75%
- Use vLLM or TensorRT-LLM for inference optimization
- Consider batch sizes: start conservative (batch_size=1 per GPU), increase after validation

### 1.3 Data Pipeline Characterization

**Throughput Requirements:**
```
Required Storage Throughput = (GPU Count) × (Tokens/sec/GPU) × (Bytes per Token)

Example: 32 GPUs processing 4000 tokens/sec/GPU with 2 bytes/token overhead
  = 32 × 4000 × 2 = 256 Gbps storage throughput needed
```

**Data Collection Worksheet:**
- Model parameters (billions)
- Training dataset size (TB/GB)
- Inference requests per second
- Concurrent users/sessions
- Data preprocessing pipeline latency (target: <10ms)
- Cache strategy (hot data, working set size)
- Data format (NFS, S3, parquet, pickle, etc.)

### 1.4 Scale Unit Matching

| Use Case | Recommended SU | GPU Config | Training Duration | Notes |
|----------|---|---|---|---|
| Development/Testing | SU1 | 32× H200 or 16× B300 | < 1 week | Quick iteration, fast prototyping |
| Fine-tuning | SU1-SU2 | 32-64× H200 or 16-32× B300 | 1-4 weeks | Moderate scale, cost-effective |
| Large-scale Training | SU2-SU3 | 64-128× H200 or 32-64× B300 | 2-12 weeks | Production workloads |
| Inference | SU1 | 32× RTX6000 or 32× RTX4500 | Continuous | Cost-efficient, lower latency needs |
| Mixed (Train + Infer) | SU2 | 32× H200 or 16× B300 + 32× RTX6000/RTX4500 | Varies | Separate fabrics recommended |

## 2. GPU Interconnect Topology Design

### 2.1 Training vs. Inference Topology

**Training Topology (Backend Fabric Critical):**
- High-speed, low-latency GPU-to-GPU communication via backend fabric
- Distributed data parallelism, gradient synchronization every iteration
- All-reduce operation bandwidth: critical bottleneck (target >45 GB/s per rail for 400Gbps fabric)
- Typical all-reduce latency target: <100 microseconds
- Recommendation: Dedicated 400G backend leaf-spine with low-latency switches

**Inference Topology (Frontend Only):**
- Front-end network carries inference requests and responses
- Inter-GPU communication minimal (token batching may require it)
- Higher oversubscription acceptable (8:1 or 10:1)
- Recommendation: Standard 100G leaf-spine sufficient; add 400G for batch serving

### 2.2 Cisco Recommended Fabric Architecture

**Backend Fabric (GPU-to-GPU Communication):**
- **Leaf Switches:** Cisco Nexus 9332D-GX2B (32× 400G ports)
- **Spine Switches:** Cisco Nexus 9364D-GX2A (64× 400G ports)
- **Topology:** Full-mesh leaf-spine (every leaf connected to every spine)
- **Oversubscription:** 1:1 or 1.2:1 (fully non-blocking or near non-blocking)
- **Cabling:** 400G QSFP-DD optics, multimode fiber or direct-attach copper (DAC)
- **Buffer Strategy:** Deep buffers (28 MB+ per switch) for bursty communication patterns

**Frontend Fabric (Data and Management):**
- **Leaf Switches:** Cisco Nexus 9364C-GX (36× 100G ports)
- **Spine Switches:** Cisco Nexus 9508 (up to 128× 100G ports)
- **Topology:** Leaf-spine with 3:1 to 8:1 oversubscription (acceptable for serial data pipeline)
- **VLANs:** Separate for management, storage, inference, and shared services

### 2.3 Server-to-Network Connectivity

**For 8-GPU servers (B300 or H200 configurations):**
- **Port Layout:** 4× OSFP (Open Standard Form Factor) ports for backend
- **Typical Config:** All 4 ports bonded (400G each) for 1.6 Tbps aggregate backend bandwidth
- **Frontend:** 2× 100G ports for management and storage access
- **Recommended:** Dedicated NIC per fabric (backend NIC separate from frontend)

**Bond Configuration Example:**
```
Backend Interface (LACP bond):
  - 4× 400G ports → 1.6 Tbps total bandwidth
  - Reduce overhead to 400G per link for redundancy
  
Frontend Interface (Active-Backup):
  - 2× 100G ports → 100 Gbps active, 100 Gbps standby
  - Supports storage replication and management traffic
```

## 3. Network Architecture Planning

### 3.1 VLAN and Routing Design

**Recommended VLAN Layout:**

| VLAN | Purpose | Subnet | Switch | Notes |
|------|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| 10 | Management | 10.0.0.0/24 | Frontend | BMC, Intersight, monitoring |
| 20 | Storage | 10.0.20.0/24 | Frontend | NFS, iSCSI, S3 (isolated for throughput) |
| 30 | Kubernetes Pod Network | 172.16.0.0/12 | Frontend | OpenShift pods, services (overlay or L3) |
| 100-110 | Backend Fabric | Point-to-point (no VLAN) | Backend | Direct GPU-to-GPU communication (routed) |

### 3.2 RoCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet) Configuration

**For 400G Backend Fabric:**
```
Priority Flow Control (PFC):
  - Enable on CoS 3 (dedicated to RDMA)
  - Prevent packet drops on RDMA flows
  
Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN):
  - Enable on all buffer drops
  - Allows switches to signal congestion
  
Per-Flow Fairness:
  - Distribute bandwidth equally across flows
  - Prevent any single GPU pair from monopolizing fabric
  
Link-Level Flow Control:
  - Disable (use PFC instead)
```

### 3.3 Bandwidth Allocation Strategy

**GPU-to-GPU Allocation (Training):**
- 80% of 400G per link ≈ 320 Gbps dedicated to all-reduce
- 20% reserved for other collective operations (broadcast, scatter-gather)

**Data Pipeline (Shared Storage + Management):**
- Separate frontend VLAN to isolate storage I/O
- 100 Gbps per server for storage (12.5 Gbps per GPU)
- Allows parallel data loading while GPUs compute

---

## 4. Storage Strategy and Validation

### 4.1 Storage Throughput Requirements

**Formula:**
```
Minimum Storage Bandwidth = GPU Count × 12.5 Gbps per GPU

Examples:
- 8-GPU server: 100 Gbps minimum dedicated storage bandwidth
- 32-GPU cluster (SU1): 400 Gbps minimum
- 64-GPU cluster (SU2): 800 Gbps minimum
```

### 4.2 Recommended Storage Solutions

**Cisco AI Pods Validated Storage Partners:**

| Partner | Solution | Best For | Throughput | Notes |
|---------|----------|----------|-----------|-------|
| EverPure (Pure Storage) | FlashArray//X | Training data archive | 10+ GB/s | All-flash, low latency, snapshot-friendly |
| NetApp | AFF A900 + FlexGroup | Scale-out NAS | 20+ GB/s | Dynamic filesystem expansion, cloud-ready |
| VAST Data | VAST Platform | Big data, unstructured | 30+ GB/s | Object + POSIX interface, cost-effective |
| Qumulo | Qumulo File System | Real-time analytics | 15+ GB/s | Kubernetes-native, multi-cloud capable |

### 4.3 Storage Technologies to Enable

**NFS over RDMA:**
- Reduce latency by offloading NFS protocol to NICs
- Direct RDMA reads/writes from GPU to storage
- Supported by NetApp, VAST, Qumulo
- Typical latency improvement: 50-70% reduction

**NVIDIA GPUDirect Storage:**
- Direct GPU-to-NVMe path (bypass CPU/RAM)
- Kernel bypass for maximum performance
- Requires CUDA 11.2+ and compatible storage driver
- Measurable improvement for sequential I/O workloads

**S3 Object Storage Integration:**
- Distributed training datasets in S3-compatible buckets
- Scale beyond single filesystem limits
- Use huggingface datasets, DVC, or S3 fuse mounts
- Throughput depends on object size and parallel requests

### 4.4 Capacity Planning

```
Minimum Capacity = (Dataset Size) × (Replication Factor) + (Snapshots/Backups)

Example: 10 TB dataset with 3× replication and 30% snapshot overhead
  = (10 TB × 3) + (10 TB × 3 × 0.30) = 39 TB minimum

Growth Buffer: Add 20-30% for future workloads and intermediate results
```

## 6. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### 6.1 Common Planning Pitfalls

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Underestimating storage bandwidth | Training blocked on I/O waits | Use UCS Sizer to validate data pipeline; run data load tests during POC |
| Undersizing backend fabric | All-reduce bottleneck, poor scaling efficiency | Target 400G full mesh with <1.2:1 oversubscription |
| Mixed GPU models in cluster | Uneven training speed, load balancing challenges | Standardize on single GPU type per cluster; use UCS Sizer for final config |
