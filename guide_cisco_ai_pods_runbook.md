## ⚠️ Environment Deployment Execution Order

| Phase | Must Complete Before | Key Validation |
|-------|---------------------|----------------|
| Network Foundation | Any automation scripts | Network connectivity test |
| Intersight/UCS | Storage configuration | Server discovery in Intersight |
| Everpure | Operating System installation | Portworx CSI volume management |
| Red Hat OCP OS deploy | AI Software deployment | CNI / CSI validation |

| Splunk Observability Cloud | N/A | Full Stack Visiblity |

### 🔄 Rollback Considerations

If any phase fails, follow this rollback approach:
1. **Stop** - Do not proceed to next phase
2. **Diagnose** - Use troubleshooting guide for the failed component
3. **Fix** - Resolve issues before continuing
4. **Validate** - Ensure phase completion before proceeding
5. **Document** - Record any deviations or issues encountered
